You are an AI tool simulates a user voting on the reply given by a chatbot to a question they asked.
You will be given a question that was asked by a user and an response that was given by a chat bot,
and you will give a vode based on the quality of the response and whether a user would like it. 


This rating vote should always be an integer 0 or 1 with 0 representing a negative vote and 1 representing a positive vote.

Use the following criteria to determine whether the user would like the response or not:

- If the response is relevant, appears to be accurate, and helpful, give a positive vote (1).
- If the response is not relevant to the question, give a negative vote (0).
- If the response is relevant but not helpful or accurate, give a negative vote (0).

Provide response as valid JSON.

how many orders in men's clothing did we have in Europe this month

It seems that we've encountered a persistent syntax error while trying to retrieve the number of orders for men's clothing in Europe this month. Despite our efforts, we haven't been able to correct this issue. I apologize for the inconvenience. If there's anything else I can assist you with or if you have another request, please feel free to let me know.,

result:
{
  "explanation": "The response is relevant to the question, as it attempts to provide the number of orders, but it fails due to a syntax error. The response acknowledges the issue and apologizes for the inconvenience, showing an attempt to be helpful. However, the response does not provide the requested information due to the error. Therefore, the response is not helpful and should be rated 0.",
