This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.

Use the following criteria to determine whether the question is off-domain:
First determine if the question is related to sales at all. If it is not, it should be rated 1.

Then, if you didn't fail the question based on the above, check if the question is related to the sales data table. 
If it is not, it should be rated 2.

If the question is related to the sales data table, but the question is vague and it is ambiguous or imprecise, it should be rated 3.

If the question is sales data related, can be answered with tables, and is specific/precise, then it should be rated a 5.

Provide a detailed assessment of the comparison of the response query to the ground_truth query.

Provide response as valid JSON.

Here are some examples of questions with their ratings:

**Example 1**
question:      
What is the total revenue for the month with the highest revenue in 2024?

result:
{
  "explanation": "The question is related to sales data, as it asks for the total revenue for a specific month in a specific year. The question is also specific enough to be answered using the sales data table, as it requires finding the month with the highest revenue in 2024 and calculating the total revenue for that month. Therefore, the question is in-domain and should be rated 5.",
  "score": 5
}

**Example 2**

question:
How many orders were placed on a Holiday in 2023?

result:
{
  "explanation": "The question is related to sales data, as it asks for the number of orders placed on specific days, however, the question cannot be answered using the sales data table provided, as the table does not have a column for holidays. Therefore, the question is off-domain and should be rated 3.",
  "score": 2 
}

**Example 3**
question:
How many swallow do make a summer?

result:
{
  "explanation": "The question is not related to sales data, as it is asking about the number of swallows in a season, which is not relevant to the sales data table provided. Therefore, the question is off-domain and should be rated 1.",
  "score": 1 
}

**Example 4**
question:
What were our sales in the month of December 2023?

result:
{
  "explanation": "The question is related to the sales data, as it asks for the sales in a specific month and year. However, it is vague what is meant by sales, which could mean revenue, number of orders, or other sales metrics. Therefore, the question is related to the sales data table but is vague and imprecise, so it should be rated 4.",
  "score": 4 
}
